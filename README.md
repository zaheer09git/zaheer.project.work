Discount Price Predictor for groceries and various items.
Firstly we took the dataset from kaggle.
We have  cleaned the data by dropping null and duplicate values.

Then we removed some unnecessary columns, code is in app.py and requirements.txt is also mentioned.
We have the source file saved in pickle file.
We made the model using logical regressoin with best possible accuracy.
So, we build a site to check how much the price of the items .
By using the site we can know the discounted price of the items.
