Discount Price Predictor for groceries and various items
Firstly we took the dataset from kaggle
we cleaned the data by dropping null and duplicate values 
removed some unnecessary columns, code is in app.py and requirements.txt is also mentioned
we have the source file saved in pickle file
we made the model using logical regressoin with best possible accuracy
so, we build a site to check how much the price of the items 
by using the site we can know the discounted price of the items.
